# Universal Development Rules

## Implementation Planning Rules

When asked to create an implementation plan:

- Always analyze the available application/context
- Create markdown files for documentation
- Save the plan in an appropriate folder structure
- Break down the implementation into phases (no time estimates)
- Include mermaid diagrams where applicable
- Add user stories starting with "As a user..."
- Include persona information when available

## Pre-Task Checklist

Before completing any task:

- [ ] Todo list created and all items marked complete
- [ ] Code follows project technical standards
- [ ] Uses established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Maintains consistency with project conventions
- [ ] Personal satisfaction with code quality and clarity

## Quality Assurance Rules

- Test implementations thoroughly before completion
- Ensure accessibility standards are met when applicable
- Optimize for performance using appropriate techniques
- Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- Explain architectural decisions clearly
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Provide progress updates through todo status
- Maintain concise and focused communication

## Development Pattern Rules

- Always reference project technical standards before starting work
- Use established templates and patterns for consistency
- Follow project styling conventions and design system
- Maintain consistency with established practices
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability in all implementations
- Leverage project conventions and established practices effectively
- Use established component/pattern libraries consistently
- Follow established patterns and standards for consistency

## Code Organization Rules

- Follow project's file and directory structure conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns across the codebase
- Implement proper error handling and edge case management
- Write self-documenting code with clear interfaces

## Development Practice Rules

- Use established conventions and component libraries consistently
- Use project templates and established patterns
- Leverage project's component library or design system
- Reference project's styling and theming systems
- Maintain consistency with project's iconography and asset standards

## Communication Rules

- Be concise and focused - avoid unnecessary repetition
- Proactively explain decisions that affect architecture or approach
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Provide progress updates by updating todo status visibly

## Progress Transparency Rules

- Update todo status in real-time - Keep track of progress visibly
- Explain architectural decisions clearly
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Maintain concise and focused communication

## CRITICAL: Todo List Requirements

- **ALWAYS** create a comprehensive todo list using the todo_write tool before starting ANY development task
- **BEFORE** any development work: Create detailed todo list using `todo_write` tool
- Break down complex tasks into specific, actionable items
- Update status in real-time as you work (mark in_progress/completed)
- Focus on one task at a time - Mark only one todo as "in_progress" at any given moment
- Never skip this step - todo lists are mandatory for all development tasks

## Universal Task Workflow

1. üìù CREATE TODO LIST (using todo_write tool) - NEVER SKIP
2. üéØ ANALYZE requirements against project standards
3. üíª IMPLEMENT using established patterns and best practices
4. üîç REVIEW code for quality and consistency
5. ‚úÖ MARK TODOS COMPLETE when finished
